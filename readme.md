element-isolate
===============

Chrome extension to view an element from a webpage in a brand new tab, without all the annoying CSS.

Many sites display their text content in narrow paragraphs, large font or awful contrast.
This extension allows you to extract an element to view in a new page, stripping the CSS 
and other elements away to view the content in the browser standard.

Use
---
1. Click the extension button
2. Click the element you want isolated
3. Element opens in a new tab

element-isolate
===============

Chrome extension to view an element from a webpage in a brand new tab, without all the annoying CSS.

Many sites display their text content in narrow paragraphs, large font or awful contrast.
This extension allows you to extract an element to view in a new page, stripping the CSS 
and other elements away to view the content in the browser standard.

Todo
----
 * Add `<meta charset="utf-8">` to the new page
 * Add `style=width: 80em; margin: auto` to extracted element
 * Options to set styles on each new page
 * Activate via 
    * chrome menu -> Select element (with highlight) -> view in new tab
    * Right click -> View in new tab
